# Immediate Concerns

- algorithmicStockTrader3 is broken (see contracts.txt)
- totalWaysToSum is broken (see contracts.txt)
- other contracts!
- slum snakes (+4=17)
- tetrads (+5=22)
- syndicate? (combat 200)
- speakers for the dead? (combat 300)
- the dark army? (Chongqing)
- megacorps? I wanna get 40 queued augs...
- other city rep & augs (another run)


# Future Ideas

- script for joining factions and buying augs?
- what is the . hostname?
- infiltrate?
    - increase combat stats (more than 20, apparently. a scraper for difficulty, then gym script?)
    - infiltrate
    - sell to faction for rep
- a script that determines the *best* target (incorporating time to grow/weaken/hack)
