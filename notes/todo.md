# Immediate Concerns

- map out how many augmentations are left
    if you need to reset, use the neuroflux governor
- totalWaysToSum is broken (see contracts.txt)
- other contracts!
- syndicate
- speakers for the dead? (combat 300)
- the dark army? (go to Chongqing)
- megacorps? I wanna get moar augmentations!
- other city rep & augs (Chongqing, New Tokyo, Ishima, Volhaven)


# Future Ideas

- script for joining factions and buying augs?
- a script that determines the *best* target (incorporating time to grow/weaken/hack)
