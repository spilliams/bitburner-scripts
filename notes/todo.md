# Immediate Concerns

- totalWaysToSum is broken
- be able to run more bots while orch is started, and later tell orch how many
  bots we added? or maybe it's smart enough to poll the servers to ask how many
  copies of the payload it's running?

# Future Ideas

- script joining factions / buying augs
- script buying Tor and port-busters
- script a backdoor
- script the early-game patterns (studying at uni, getting a job, etc)
- explore stock market...
